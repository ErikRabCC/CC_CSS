# What are CSS frameworks/libraries?

At this time, you already become familiar with the **basics** of `CSS`, 
you can **style** most `HTML` `elements` with a variety of `CSS` `properties`, but for you to be a more efficient developer, more is needed.

During real-life development, especially if you aren't working on a public website or web application, and your application will only be used in the internal network of a company, then having very unique and stunning styling might not be your absolute priority, but at the same time, your application needs to look decently since people are going to use it potentially daily.

In situations like this, very often you may measure the possibility of using a CSS framework or library.

A **CSS library** basically contains a bunch of **pre-written CSS**. Commonly used components have multiple **responsive** styles, they look professional but are oftentimes reasonably simple. It is also common, that these pre-written styles are already responsive and there are pre-written **CSS classes** that you can use to support **multiple screen sizes** and devices, so you don't have to write everything from scratch, instead, you can use a **well-tested** solution right away.

There is an abundance of CSS libraries and frameworks, but if you can use one or two of these libraries, the third won’t be much of a challenge.
Bootstrap is a widely known and reliable CSS library, and you’ll learn how to use it too.

Sidenote: Most of the projects contain some tasks about how to style them in the end,
but you are encouraged to go wild sometimes if you have an idea about how else could the project be made more visually appealing.
