# What are CSS frameworks/libraries?

At this time, you already become familiar with the **basics** of `CSS`, 
you can **style** most `HTML` `elements` with a variety of `CSS` `properties`, but for you to be a more efficient developer, more is needed.

During real-life development, especially if you **aren't** working on a **public website** or **web application**, and your application will only be used in the internal network of a company, then having very unique and stunning **styling** might **not** be your absolute **priority**, but at the same time, your application needs to look decently since people are going to use it potentially daily.

In situations like this, very often you may measure the possibility of using a `CSS framework` or `library`.

A `CSS library` basically contains a bunch of **pre-written CSS**. Commonly used components have multiple **responsive** styles, they look professional but are oftentimes reasonably simple. It is also common, that these pre-written styles are already responsive and there are pre-written `CSS classes` that you can use to support **multiple screen sizes** and devices, so you don't have to write everything from scratch, instead, you can use a **well-tested** solution right away.

There is an abundance of `CSS libraries` and `frameworks`, but if you can use one or two of these libraries, the third won’t be much of a challenge.
`Bootstrap` is a **widely known** and **reliable** `CSS library`, and you’ll learn how to use it too.

*Sidenote: Most of the projects contain some tasks about how to style them in the end,
but you are encouraged to go wild sometimes if you have an idea about how else could the project be made more visually appealing*.

# Why should you as a developer consider using such solutions?

It all comes down to your **priorities** regarding the **project** **considering** the **target audience**.

For example, when it comes to a `public website` and your **priority** is to give the best **impression** to the **user** about a project or a company, then chances are that your priority will be to have a very smooth, very **modern looking**, very accessible and **visually appealing design**.

Surely you would give a lot of attention to details lookswise and you would try to come up with something unique. 

Most **people judge** things greatly by their **first experiences** interacting with them, so it makes sense that you would **try** to make something **less generic** and less repetitive.

Now think about a `browser-based` `application` that is primarily used in an **office** by more technical people or in an **administration**-heavy sector.

Now your **focus** has **changed**, the goal is to put **less** effort into **appearance** and **more** on **functionality** and just displaying data in a **user-friendly** manner.

In this case, your **goal** is to be as **simple** as possible, the app has to be very straightforward with as **few distractions** as possible but still has to be styled in a way that it's not pure pain to use on a daily basis.

Here is where `CSS libraries/frameworks` come in handy.

# What are the advantages of using a CSS framework/library?

To put it simply a `CSS framework/library` is just a bunch of **pre-written** `CSS` and potentially some JS code that you can apply to your HTML elements by passing certain class names to them.

A solution like this can contain pre-written CSS to set:
- The layout inside of a container element
- Design for basic HTML elements (eg.: button, input, select etc.) including hover effects and other simple effects
- Rules for different screen sizes or sometimes you don't even have to set these rules because the default behavior is more than satisfactory

These work out of the box and they can integrated into any project with relative ease.


# Recap

- CSS frameworks/libraries are usually used for projects where a more generic design is more than satisfactory and there isn't a great emphasis on detailed, good-looking visuals. 
- Most CSS frameworks/libraries come with design options for the most commonly used HTML elements, including basic animations and they can be used to set the layout of the app.
- Solutions like these can be integrated into an existing project with usually just a few imports.

# Questions

- Can you think about existing organizations or companies where you would use a CSS library to develop browser-based applications?
- Many developers could write nicer-looking designs than what these CSS libraries have to offer, what advantages does using a solution like this have?
- Please take a look at [this link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/accordion/) and search through the components section on the left, pay special attention to the provided example code snippets. Do you think that you could make a simple but user-friendly web app by only using these components?

Apart from Bootstrap it's ok if you only take a look at what components to other frameworks offer, you don't have to download them.
