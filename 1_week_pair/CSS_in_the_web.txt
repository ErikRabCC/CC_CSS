At this time, you already became familiar with the basics of CSS, 
you can style most HTML elements with a variety of CSS properties, but for you to be hirable, more is needed.

It's only natural that we want to specify where and how we want our HTMl elements to appear,
so for this we are going to use flexbox.

With flexbox you will be able to change how your HTML elements should appear, 
in more simple terms you will be able to set how these HTML elements should appear next to each other,
    should they appear in a horizontal manner or in a vertical manner,
    how to position them evenly compared to each other,
    declare how much gap should be between these components,
    any many more.



Another important factor is responsiveness.

Your Web application must support multiple screen sizes and devices. 

Your website and/or service must look good on tablets with different screen sizes,
    on phones with different screen sizes and on laptops and desktops with different screen sizes.


Your target audience will judge you and your product/service based on how visually appealing it is, so let’s work on this.


Talking about visually appealing, it’s always a nice thing to have animated elements on your page or an animated background for example, we will also look at these.


Additionally, you'll be introduce to the concept of CSS libraries, which can speed up the development process by providing ready-made styles and components.

There are an abundance of CSS libraries and frameworks, but if you can use one or two of these libraries, the third won’t be much of a challenge.
Bootstrap is a widely known and reliable CSS library, and you’ll learn how to use it too.

Sidenote: Most of the projects contain some tasks about how to style them in the end,
but you are encouraged to go wild sometimes if you have an idea about how else could the project be made more visually appealing.
