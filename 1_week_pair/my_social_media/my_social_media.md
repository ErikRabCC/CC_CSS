# My Social Media
**This is a guided project**

>To learn the most, try and implement it on your own first, and check the solution only when you feel necessary. However, if you feel completely stuck, feel free to check the step-by-step solution guide.

Social media, depending on your preferences, this can be mankind's best invention ever or a necessary evil.
But regardless of your preferences, I think we can agree that using an application you made is always better than using someone else'.

At this point, you are ready to create the layout of your own social media site.

For this project, it's perfectly ok to just create an HTML and CSS file and view them with your browser directly.

# What are you going to learn?
-   Usage of Flexbox and its properties to arrange the elements in your web application
-   Which semantic HTML element to use for common UI elements

# Tasks

**Setup**

Clone the starter repository and create a new **HTML** and **CSS** file for your project, you can call them **index.html** and **style.css**. You can also generate a simple **HTML template** with the help of your VS Code IntelliSense by typing `!` and pressing **enter**, and don't forget to import your newly created **CSS** file. 

1. **Cloned** the starter repository and create a new **HTML** and **CSS** file inside of it.
2. Generate an HTML starter **template** and **import** your newly created **CSS** file.


**Every Web App Needs a Navbar**

Create a `header` container which will contain the **title** of your app as well as some **links**. Make the **title** appear on the **left side** of your container and the **links** should appear on the right side inside of a `nav` container.

Make the **links** inside of your `nav` have `gap` between each other.

1.  Create a `header` which will serve as your **navbar**.
2.  The **title** of your app appears on the **left side** of the **navbar** as `h1`.
3.  The **links** for the **navbar** appear on the **right side** inside of a `nav` container.
4.  You can hardcode a few **links** inside of the `nav` container as anchor elements (`a`).
5.  The **links** have some amount of `gap` between each other.
6.  You can add some basic **styling** for the **navbar** eg.: changing the `background color`, setting the `font size`, adding a `hover` effect on the **links** etc. You can go wild here.


**A place for contacts, chat history and a textarea**

Generally speaking, the **main content** of your web app should go inside the `main` container.
Let's create a `main` container then, once it's done, you will want to define 3 `sections` inside of this container.

The first `section` can take up around **20%** of the **screen** and it should appear on the **left side **of the screen.

The **chat history** where you can view the conversations you had previously should take roughly the rest of the space available and below that a `textarea` should appear where you can type your message, you can also add a `button` below that with the text: *"send"*.

1.  Create a `main` container and add some **basic styles** to it (eg.: width, height etc...)
2.  Create a `section` for displaying your **contacts**, this section will take up around **20%** of the screen on the **left side**.
3.  The **chat history** and the `textarea` for sending a new message along with its button are below each other, create the `chat history` and the `textarea` along with its `button` in another `section`.


**Footer with privacy policy**

In the **EU**, every website must display, how they collect, use, store, and protect personal data in compliance with the **General Data Protection Regulation** **(GDPR)**. It's also common practice to display some links regarding your **Terms of Service** around this area.

On most websites, **links** and information about these policies and such are displayed in the `Footer`.

Let's create a `Footer` container at the bottom of the screen and display some information like this. Naturally, you don't have to come up with your own policies for this task. It's enough if you display some text there with an **empty link**.

1.  Create a `Footer` container at the bottom of the screen and add some basic styling to it (eg.: height, width)
2.  Make some text appear at the **top** of the `Footer`, here you can place some text, this will be a **placeholder** for **copyright-related** information.
3.  **Below** the **copyright** placeholder try to organize some **placeholder text** for your **Terms of Service** as well as your **Privacy policy**. Try to make them appear next to each other.


**OPTIONAL TASK: Contacts appear with style**

Could you hardcode a few contacts for demonstrational purposes in the `main` **containers** **contacts** `section`?

It's enough if you create a `div` with some text inside of it, resembling the **name** of the **contact**.
You can go further if you want to and you can add a `hover` effect to each **contact**. If you want to you can even can add a little **image** (`img`) next to the contact name.
You can wild in this one. Align the name to where you think it would be appropriate inside of the `div`.


**OPTIONAL TASK: Add further styling to the project**

Feel free to add some further styling to this project, if you got stuck, feel free to ask a mentor for help or suggestions, and be sure to show us what you managed to come up with.
